Welcome to the Material Business Starter by <span class="anoun-title">ANOUN</span>! This is the first in our series of Gatsby Starters inspired by Google's [Material Design](https://material.io). The Material Business starter features all the basics for a typical business' website such as a home page, about page, contact page with an email form, and a fully featured blog. This one is sourced from Markdown but we'll have others that use a headless CMS (stay tuned). So don't be shy, feel free to clone the [Github Repo](https://github.com/ANOUN/gatsby-starter-material-business-markdown) and get started!
